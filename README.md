# Internet Flicks

[Demo](https://internet-flicks.vercel.app/)

An online database of information relating to movies, TV shows and cast members. This project uses the TMDB API and built with the Next.js frame work. The UI is heavily inspired by the streaming service, Netflix.

## Lessons Learned

After building this web app, it has given me the confidence and made me comfortable in working with web APIs, fetching, handling promises, creating custom API routes and also building web apps with the Next.js framework.

## Potential Future Updates

- Creating a page for different Genres

- Creating MediaListSliders that uses posters so that it's not always 16:9 to make the UI more interesting.

- Implementing more TMDB features

- Performance optimization

## Deployment

Deployed with [vercel](https://www.netlify.com/).
